## About the project

![Screenshot Image](images/screenshotApple.PNG)

This is a clone of an older Apple website for the first solo project in the microverse curriculum. It is built with HTML and CSS. This is a clone of the archived Apple homepage at: https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/.

## Technologies

The technologies used were Github, VSCode, HTML/CSS, Stickler, and Stylelint.

## Acknowledgements

I used refences from the ODIN PROJECT website for technical information, as well as W3 schools, the Apple.com, and the mozilla docs for the same.
